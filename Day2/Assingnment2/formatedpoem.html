        <h2>Poem: The Coder's Light</h2>
  <p>
    In lines of code where silence hums,<br>
    A spark ignites, the logic drums.<br>
    Through loops and bugs, the mind takes flight,<br>
    Debugging dreams in endless night.<br><br>

    With every tag and nested line,<br>
    A world is shaped in structured rhyme.<br>
    The screen may glow, the keys may clack,<br>
    But passion keeps the coder on track.
