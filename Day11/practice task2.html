    <p>Biryani (/bɜːrˈjɑːni/) is a mixed rice dish originating in South Asia, traditionally made with rice, meat (chicken, goat, lamb, beef) or seafood (prawns or fish), and spices.

Biryani is one of the most popular dishes in South Asia and among the South Asian diaspora, though the dish is often associated with the region's Muslim population in particular.[1] Regional variations exist, such as regarding the addition of eggs and/or potatoes, as well as religious ones, such as the replacement of meat with paneer or vegetables by vegetarians.[2] Similar dishes are also prepared in many other countries like Iraq and Malaysia, and was often spread to such places by South Asian diaspora populations.[3][4] Biryani is the single most-ordered dish on Indian online food ordering and delivery services, and has been described as the most popular dish in India.[5][6]</p>

<p>According to the historian Lizzie Collingham, the modern biryani developed in the royal kitchens of the Mughal Empire (1526–1857) and is a mix of the native spicy rice dishes of South Asia and the Persian polao.[12] Indian restaurateur Kris Dhillon believes that the dish originated in Persia and was brought to South Asia by the Mughals.[13] Salma Hossein, whom the BBC has dubbed the "doyenne of Islamic cooking in India," shares a similar view, asserting that biryani came to South Asia from Persia even before the Mughal era. Food scholar Pushpesh Pant also challenges the Mughal-origin claim, stating that it originated in Iran and that "there is no evidence that biryani first came to this land with the Mughals. It is far more probable that it travelled with pilgrims and soldier-statesmen of noble descent to the Deccan region in South India".[14]

Another theory claims that the dish was prepared in South Asia before the first Mughal emperor Babur conquered India.[15] The 16th-century Mughal text Ain-i-Akbari makes no distinction between biryanis and pilaf (or pulao): it states that the word "biryani" is of older usage in India.[16] A similar theory, that biryani[17] came to India with Timur's invasion, appears to be incorrect because there is no record of biryani having existed in his native land during that period.[15]

Pratibha Karan, author of Biryani, writes how biryani is of Mughal origin, derived from pilaf varieties brought to the Indian subcontinent by Arab and Persian traders. She speculates that the pulao was an army dish in medieval India. Armies would prepare a one-pot dish of rice with any available red meat. Over time, the dish became biryani due to different methods of cooking, with the distinction between "pulao" and "biryani" being arbitrary.[8][15]

According to Vishwanath Shenoy, the owner of a biryani restaurant chain in India, one branch of biryani comes from the Mughals, while another was brought by the Arab traders to Malabar in South India.[18]</p>
