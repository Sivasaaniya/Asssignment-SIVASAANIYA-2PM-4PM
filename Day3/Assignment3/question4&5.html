Q4. Write two uses of semantic tags
i) Semantic tags like <header> and <article> make your code easier to read and organize.
ii) They help Google and other search engines understand your content, which can improve your ranking.

Q5. Compare semantic tags with <div> — when should each be used?

i) Semantic tags (like <header>, <article>) give meaning to content and improve accessibility and SEO.
ii) - Use <div> when you need a generic container for layout or styling without any specific meaning.
Simple rule: use semantic tags for structure and meaning, <div> for layout only.
